###### **How to use the Code**

Copy this MasterCode into your prefered IDE and make sure to use data spell to show you the plot of the graph.

When running this code, it'll require 2 inputs. 
Firstly, it'll ask for the number of people who will be part of the simulation. 
This will need to be an integer greater than or equal to 100.
Secondly, you'll need to input the number of days you want the simulation to run, preferably greater than 30 days.
Finally, the parameters for the virus to spread are not accurate. This'll lead to the simulation infecting people and then after a few days the initial infected people will recover/die and then the virus wont spread any further. So, the user would need to run the code with the corresponding parameters more than once to see the effects of the virus.
