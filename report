Hexagons
For our project we have created a simulation of covid spread using a hexagonal tile grid. The idea behind this is that unlike the square grid which spreads like a diamond or a square depending on what squares around it you consider to be in contact, The hexagonal grid spreads in more of a circular format. This is due to the hexagon being the shape with the most amounts of sides (closest to the circle) that can be place in a tile/grid format.
This changes the way it can be represented in python as we had to make a matrix array of numbers which would change as their state changes from susceptible to infected to dead or recovered. We also included a vaccinated variable which reduced the hexagons chance of dying therefore improving their chance for recovering which had a chance of being given to a random hexagon. We created lists of the all the variables as they went through the simulation to append to a line graph which went on to show us that the infected count reduces over time due to the deaths, recovery count and the reduced rate of infection from the vaccinations. The graph would often flatten out towards the end of the days as the infections would be stopped by the recovered, vaccinated and dead.But overall continued to give results similar to that of an exponential function for the suseptable, and a bell curve for the infection.
